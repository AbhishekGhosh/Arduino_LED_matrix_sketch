Arduino Writing Text Sketch
============================
A multi-user chat-like application that sends typed messages to an arduino. The arduino prints the messages at a very high speed through an LED matrix. Wave the LED screen quickly to see the letters, or better yet, take pictures with a camera set to slow shutter speed and see the messages printed out in the air.


##Setting Up the Arduino and MAX7219 Matrix

###Components you'll need:
  * Arduino Uno board
  * 5 jumper wires (female/male)
  * MAX7219 Red Dot Matrix Display Module
  * Arduino USB cable

###Connecting the Components

1. LED matrix connections to arduino:
  * VCC to 5V
  * GND to GND
  * DIN to Digital 2
  * CS to Digital 4
  * CLK to Digital 3

2. Connect the USB cable to your computer.

###Setting up the Arduino Sketch

1. Download the Arduino software if you have not already: http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Software

2. Download and uncompress a ZIP file of this repo.

3. Look for the **libraries** folder inside the folder where you installed the Arduino software. Make sure you close all the open windows of Arduino IDE when you do this.

4. Copy the uncompressed repo folder, delete the README.md file within, and place it inside the libraries folder.

5. Open the Arduino software again. Go to **File > Examples > Arduino_LED_matrix_sketch**

6. Under the **Tools** menu make sure the correct Board and Serial Port are selected.

7. Verify and upload the sketch to your arduino to see the text print to your LED Matrix!

8. Experiment with slow exposure photography to write messages in your photos.
